## Introduction  
bbRealm is our team name, and this site is currently created and maintained by Corebb. One of the purposes of establishing this site was interest, and I found that using MDX to write documentation is well-suited for organizing various types of materials with high flexibility for customizing pages, such as directly displaying 3D models. Currently, the site mainly contains manuals for products being sold and resources for open-source projects. In the future, we will gradually add content and incorporate more materials related to bbRealm.

## Product Purchase Channels  
I (Corebb) have created many interesting works, almost all of which are open-source. I share these projects because my knowledge also comes from the internet, and I hope to give back these resources to everyone. Some of my projects are not suitable for mass production and commercial applications for specific reasons, and interested friends can replicate them through the open-source materials and tutorials. However, some projects are stable enough for mass production, and I really enjoy the process of personally producing and shipping these works. If you like my creations or want to support my work, you can purchase them through the following channels.
