## Step 1: Install the Desktop Software (Required)
- First, download and install the bbHome software.
<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard title="Windows Version" href="/bbMonitor/bbHome_1.1.6_x64-setup.exe" />
  <LinkCard style="opacity:0.5;" title="Linux Version (Coming Soon)" />
  <LinkCard style="opacity:0.5;" title="macOS Version (Coming Soon)" />
</CardGrid>

## Step 2: Connect the Device (Required)
- Use the provided USB-A to USB-C cable to connect **your computer** to the back port of the bbMonitor.

- Ensure the bbMonitor is connected to your computer. If you have multiple bbMonitors, you can connect and configure them simultaneously.
- In the list, you will see the recognized USB serial devices. The bbMonitor's ID is usually COM3, with numbers increasing if multiple devices are connected.
- Enter your Wi-Fi name and password below, then click "Provision".

<Aside title="Note">
  Please enter the 2.4Ghz Wi-Fi information.<br></br>
  Wi-Fi networks ending with "_5" are usually 5Ghz, which most IoT devices do not support.
</Aside>
<Aside title="Ensure your computer and Wi-Fi are on the same local network">
  For example, if your computer is connected to the router via an Ethernet cable, make sure to set the bbMonitor to connect to the same router.

## Step 4: Adjust Settings and Brightness (Optional)
- Click any bbMonitor card to configure it.
- Upon clicking, RGB lighting will display, allowing you to identify the specific device if multiple bbMonitors are present.

## Step 5: Change the Dial (Optional)
- If needed, you can change the bbMonitor dial to customize the display content to your preference.
- You can specify this during purchase to have it pre-installed, saving you this step.
- To change the dial, first unscrew the dial cover.
- Since the LED and dial cover are glued together, you need to unscrew all the screws. Alternatively, you can forcibly pull out a single dial cover, as the pressure-sensitive acrylic adhesive allows for multiple reattachments.

## Completion
- Now you’re all set up! The software starts automatically on boot. You can find it in the system tray at the bottom right corner of your computer screen.
- You can now connect the bbMonitor to any 5V USB port without occupying your computer’s USB port.
- Note that clicking the X at the top right corner of the software minimizes it instead of closing it. To close the software, right-click the system tray icon and select "×" from the pop-up menu.
